A. 7 commits: The original repository included 5 commits, and we made 2 more; one when deleting DELETEME and editing README, and the other when adding status.txt. 
	
B. It was added to the original repository 4 years ago that we then forked and cloned.

C. Git status lets you inspect the working directory and the staging area, while git log only operates on the committed history.

D. An untracked file exists locally but isn't yet part of the git repository. By comparison, an unstaged file does exist in the working directory.

E. Reset alters the index without changing the working tree, while checkout does change the working tree but doesn't touch the index.

F. You will get a merge conflict if the uncommitted files have overlap with the changes that are being pulled.
